Default page content for extensions/features
----

Add per-extension or per-feature XML dumps here. XML dumps are generated by [[Special:Export]].

Any XML files in this directory will be automatically imported when wikis are created.

You may also include a txt file listing the pages that are included in your dump, to assist others in maintaining the dump.

Default page content for extensions/features
----

Add XML dumps here. XML dumps are generated by [[Special:Export]].

Use the name of the extension/service/skin or as a prefix to only import the dump when it is installed,
e.g. `extensions-VisualEditor.xml` or `extensions-VisualEditor-tables.xml`

Use the "core-" prefix to always import a dump,
e.g. `core-userpages.xml`

You should also include a corresponding `.txt` file listing the pages that are included in your dump, to assist others in maintaining the dump.
